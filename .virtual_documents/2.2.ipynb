# looking at the files, these columns are names/addresses, and can be read as strings


# Use pd.concat to combine all CSV files into one DataFrame.
# The generator expression reads each file in the 'filepath' list using pd.read_csv.
# The dtype={5: str, 7: str} ensures that columns 5 and 7 (0-indexed) are read as strings,
# which avoids issues with mixed data types (e.g., numbers and text in the same column).
# The ignore_index=True ensures the resulting DataFrame has a continuous, reindexed index.
